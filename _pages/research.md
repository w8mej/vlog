### Gyoithon - machine learning penetration testing automation

Driving penetration testing’s AI explosion, we are creating an AI-driven penetration testing tool. Start with offensive security data sets, genetic algorithms, neural networks and increase the layers and neurons. We have been running massive amounts of data through the system to train it. We have hit commercial success. The commercial version passes the Hacker Turing test.

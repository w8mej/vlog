I love programming in PHP.  Fairly simple to learn, easy to code, plenty of
tools available, and great community.  However, due to the language's inherent
behaviour, PHP has many security pitfalls.  There isn't any one magic php
bullet to proactively manage unexpected behavior.  That is why I propose the
new PHP hammer.  One needs to push one's code to Production.  Then smash
Production's machine with the PHP Hammer of Justice to work out any bugs.  

Seriously though; [safe mode](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.sect.safe-mode.php)
and [suhosin](http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/) will put you leagues above
your competition.  Remember, you do not need to run faster than the bear.  You
just need to run faster than your competition.  Well, until you become a
trophy.

For technical problems, one may struggle to define the specifications. When
this happens, look at the behavioral design. Then one may find solutions from
the design automation. Thankfully, evolution algorithms are a class of “soft
computing” techniques which handles poor specifications. One will encounter
direct application of the evolutionary algorithms via Neural networks,
ReCaptcha, and / or Amazon Turk.  All which have been applied to solve noisy
pattern recognition.

Evolvable hardware techniques have important advantages over neural networks.
Hardware is really fast and are more easily understood / implemented than
neural networks with fast operations and solution tractability. For these
purposes, evolvable hardware has been developed for academic, military and
industrial applications. So let’s borrow from them instead of reinventing the
wheel.

With appropriate automation, evolvable hardware has a large potential to
autonomously adapt to the constantly changing risk environment. This is
extremely useful for situations where (real-time approaches nano-seconds) over
systems is improbable / impossible. It doesn’t hurt evolvable hardware is
useful when harsh or unexpected data points, threats, vulnerabilities, risks,
and other conditions are encountered.

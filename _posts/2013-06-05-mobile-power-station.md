A bit back, I looked over [Stavrou's USB smartphone
paper](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-dc-11/Stavrou-
Wang/BlackHat_DC_2011_Stavrou_Zhaohui_USB_exploits-wp.pdf).  Interesting
research.  Well done.   All one needs to do is take a tacticle jacket,
malicious usb-enabled laptop, spraypaint a large, trustworthy brand name, then
head to your local concert venue.  If one is paranoid about victims stealing
the USB cords, epoxy the cords to your ports.  While walking around the venue,
look for those on their phone.  Once discovered, ask them if they would like a
free charge.   Before you know it, you will look like the following;

If you have ever used OpenSSL, [please donate money to this worthy
cause](https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/lets-make-sure-heartbleed-doesnt-
happen-again).  Your donation will go towards security and cryptographic
researchers who are financially (or egotistically) motivated to discover
security-related defects in OpenSSL’s intellectual property.   Trust me,
OpenSSL needs it!!!!!!!!  See the below picture for a simple, secure code
review on [OpenSSL’s latest release](http://www.openssl.org/source/), 1.0.1g.

What we see is typical of an older, open source C / C++ based application.
Overall, there are code quality issues in addition to common C / C++ software
security defects.  Fortunately, some of the bugs require unique situations to
exist.  Unfortunately, as we saw in HeartBleed, other defects are straight
forward and easily exploitable.

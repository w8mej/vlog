---
"...What nobody tells people who are beginners — and I really wish someone had
told this to me . . . is that all of us who do creative work, we get into it
because we have good taste. For example, you want to make TV because you LOVE
TV. There is stuff that you just LOVE.

So you have really good taste. But you get into this thing where there is this
gap. For the first couple years you are making stuff… but what you’re making
isn’t so good. It’s not that great. It’s trying to be good, it has ambition to
be good, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game,
your taste is still killer. And your taste is good enough that you can tell
that what you’re making is a disappointment to you. It’s still sorta crappy.

A lot of people never get past this phase. They quit. But the thing I would
say to you with all my heart: most everyone I know who does interesting,
creative work, went through years of this. We knew our work didn’t have this
special thing that we wanted it to have. Everybody goes through this.

If you are just starting this phase, still in this phase, getting out of this
phase, you gotta know it’s totally normal and the most important, possible
thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself
on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you will finish one
story. You create the deadline. It’s best if you have someone waiting for the
work, even if it’s somebody that doesn’t pay you. It is only by going through
a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good
as your ambitions.

In my case, I took longer to figure out how to do this than anybody I’ve ever
met. It takes awhile. It’s going to take you awhile. It’s normal to take
awhile. And you just have to fight your way through that...."

excerpt: This vulnerability allows one to bypass weak XSS filtering
---
This vulnerability allows one to bypass weak XSS filtering / validation on
vulnerable installations of LDAP Tool Box. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open or browse a malicious
link.  

The vulnerable weak XSS filtering mechanism will prevent some but not all XSS
injections.  It really depends on the execution context.  Relying on the
htmlentities encoding function is equivalent to using a very weak blacklist.  

I have written a proof-of-concept exploit which causes a fake login page, with
corresponding javascript key logger, to render in the victim's browser.  

 _**Affected Products**_

All installations of LDAP Tool Box which does not have the [appropriate patch
applied](http://tools.ltb-project.org/attachments/591/XSSvalidation.patch)

** _Remediation_**

Until LDAP Tool Box releases an upgraded version, please apply the patch
[found here](http://tools.ltb-
project.org/attachments/591/XSSvalidation.patch).

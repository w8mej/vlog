A great beta tool to checkbox their AWS infrastructure and account to known

> “Scout2 is a security tool that lets AWS administrators asses their
> environment’s security posture. Using the AWS API, Scout2 gathers
> configuration data for manual inspection and highlights high-risk areas
> automatically. Rather than pouring through dozens of pages on the web,
> Scout2 supplies a clear view of the attack surface automatically.”

Well, Jessica, let me help you.  I can’t tell you what makes a good Snapchat
username.  But what I can tell you is what makes a popular Snapchat username.

 _**Top 10 base words in the username**_

chris = 779 (0.02%)

alex = 744 (0.02%)

mike = 691 (0.01%)

ashley = 612 (0.01%)

nick = 585 (0.01%)

anthony = 547 (0.01%)

matt = 521 (0.01%)

jess = 504 (0.01%)

steph = 491 (0.01%)

amanda = 490 (0.01%)

 _**The length of a username**_

3 = 1605 (0.03%)

4 = 15460 (0.34%)

5 = 80193 (1.74%)

6 = 230707 (5.0%)

7 = 419731 (9.11%)

8 = 594500 (12.9%)

9 = 644745 (13.99%)

10 = 635258 (13.78%)

11 = 563808 (12.23%)

12 = 484685 (10.51%)

13 = 385229 (8.36%)

14 = 297672 (6.46%)

15 = 256023 (5.55%)

18 = 1 (0.0%)

20 = 2 (0.0%)

26 = 1 (0.0%)

29 = 1 (0.0%)

 _**The most popular character sets to create a username**_

allstring: 2076601 (45.05%)

stringdigit: 1619213 (35.13%)

stringspecialstring: 509677 (11.06%)

othermask: 191237 (4.15%)

stringspecialdigit: 120925 (2.62%)

stringdigitstring: 91968 (2.0%)

 _**If you wanted to end your username in digits, these are the ten most
popular 4 digits**_

2013 = 5340 (0.12%)

1234 = 4750 (0.1%)

2000 = 3048 (0.07%)

2012 = 2432 (0.05%)

1991 = 2045 (0.04%)

1990 = 2019 (0.04%)

1994 = 2010 (0.04%)

2345 = 1988 (0.04%)

1992 = 1926 (0.04%)

1993 = 1916 (0.04%)

 _**On a more serious note**_

It is worth mentioning not many usernames share different phone numbers.  Out
of 4.6 million phone numbers, only a few share the same username.  This is an
interesting.  Why?  I am not certain.  I wonder if these are internal test
accounts:

baten_tp = 2 (0.0%)

giggless14 = 2 (0.0%)

majestick666 = 2 (0.0%)

queenofthisshit = 2 (0.0%)

spoon4real = 2 (0.0%)

dorabuggz = 2 (0.0%)

gala.pardo = 1 (0.0%)

erinspickles = 1 (0.0%)

flyinghorses = 1 (0.0%)

saraelizabeth98 = 1 (0.0%)

The image below shows the role confirmatory bias can play in social
engineering exploits. Two situations are depicted. In the first, the insider
desires access to information supplied by the outsider’s created (deceptive)
scenario, as depicted in the R2 (orange) feedback loop. The second is where
the insider desires to be helpful to the malicious outsider in need as

of trust in the outsider’s authenticity and the subsequent desire to access
information or to be helpful.

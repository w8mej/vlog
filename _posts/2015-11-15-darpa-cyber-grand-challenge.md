With the coming IoT advent, the future requires architecturally different
thought paradigms to keep our information safe.  Especially with the pending
cryptoapocalypse.  I have been taking lessons learned from DARPA’s Cyber
Grand Challenge and applying it to our automation.  The challenge is having a
variety of complex systems to tune, correlate, improve, and decimate.  As a
result, I have started to collect a variety of CTF and various OSINT
penetration testing labs.   If you want to play with them, you may find the

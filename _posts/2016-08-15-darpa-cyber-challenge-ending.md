This Thursday, seven research institutions will compete against each other.
Unlike other typical hacker challenges, their automations will compete on
their behalf.  The winning team will take home $2,000,000.00.  The automated
programs will crack, patch, and defend applications / networks.  I will be
there with my teammates as our program cracks and hacks.  You should come on
by and cheer us on.  The live feed may be found @

## _**3 years in the making**_

It has been an exciting three years.  So exciting that I have been writing
blog posts about it during the progression of the team and competition.  After
Friday, I am allowed to publish this series.

 _**  The Team and Competition**_

It has been an interesting competition with my global peers.  While others are
savants with regards to patching; my education, experience, and skill set
lends itself naturally to software program cracking at big data scale and
defending cloud networks with no human intervention in a minor capacity.  We
plan to prove the world Skynet is nearly upon us.  However, when we all came
together, we had a negative outlook we had to turn around: the techniques and
automation required is subtle enough that it is not clear if the programs will
be able to attack and defend at scale.



_**The series will cover the following red team at scale subject matters and
philosophies**_

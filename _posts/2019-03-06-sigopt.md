Upon suggestion from Mr. Hay, I took https://sigopt.com/ for a spin.  I
plugged it into our SIEM and Vulnerability models.  I am astonished.  Just
when I thought every bit of value was squeezed from the systems, it is
continuing to pull out indicators and APT actors like candy at a weight loss
camp.  One should give it a spin when they need to further optimize their
models.  For blackhats, this technique will become a significant pain as
additional academic savy private sector practitioners move beyond log
management and playbooks.

It was many and many a year ago,

In a realm of digital glow,

That the Cypherpunks came to know,

A love for privacy, like a river's flow.

So they wrote code, both night and day,

In the name of secrecy, they paved the way,

For encryption, like a lover's sway,

To guard the whispers they had to say.

But the winds of change did fiercely blow,

And governments sought to overthrow,

The secrets kept from the status quo,

Yet the Cypherpunks resisted, ever so.

For their love for privacy, it ran so deep,

In their hearts, the secrets they'd keep,

In encrypted messages, their secrets would sleep,

As they guarded their freedoms, their souls to keep.

But one fateful day, in the digital night,

The forces of control, with all their might,

Came knocking at the door, shining their light,

Seeking to quench the privacy's might.

And they cried with a voice that could wake the dead,

"We demand your secrets," they loudly said,

But the Cypherpunks, they shook their heads,

For their love for privacy was still widespread.

So they wrote the code and encrypted the lore,

For the love of privacy, they'd fight and explore,

In memory of secrets, for evermore,

The Cypherpunks' love, like the sea's distant shore.

But the forces of control, they could not break,

The love for privacy, for the Cypherpunks' sake,

Their secrets remained, a fortress they'd make,

For in the digital darkness, their love would not quake.

And so in this realm, where data streams,

The Cypherpunks hold fast to their dreams,

For in the name of privacy, their love gleams,

Like the stars in the night, where the truth redeems.

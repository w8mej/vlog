**It‚Äôs one thing to train a model in a notebook. It‚Äôs another to scale that model across multiple clouds, regions, and time zones‚Äîscoring millions of events in near-real-time.**

Energy-Based Models (EBMs) give you power. But that power has a price: compute, latency, and orchestration at scale.

To operationalize autonomous detection and response, you need to architect your system with **the same rigor you apply to production infrastructure.** This post breaks down what it takes to go from ‚Äúwe trained a model‚Äù to ‚Äúwe detect and respond across the globe in under 100ms.‚Äù

## üß† The Mental Model: Detection as a Global Service

Think of anomaly detection like a CDN for risk:
- Data comes in from multiple regions.
- Each region needs **low-latency inference** for scoring.
- Models must stay **synchronized and version-controlled**.
- Response logic must **execute locally but report globally**.

This isn‚Äôt a batch job. This is **a distributed real-time inference network**‚Äîwith security consequences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Components of the Infrastructure

### ‚úÖ 1. **Regional Inference Nodes**
Deployed in proximity to data sources (e.g., GCP regions, AWS AZs)  
‚Üí Reduce latency, minimize egress  
‚Üí Host TorchScript-compiled EBM models  
‚Üí Serve inference via REST or streaming

### ‚úÖ 2. **Centralized Model Registry + Sync Layer**
Manages:
- Versioned models
- Canary vs. production rollouts
- Drift detection
- Global synchronization using CDN or blob storage (e.g., GCS/S3 + Cloudflare)

### ‚úÖ 3. **CI/CD for Models + Playbooks**
Models and playbooks are promoted through:
- Simulated testing environments
- Canary regional deployment
- Performance regression tracking
- Cost characteristics

### ‚úÖ 4. **GPU Tiering**
- **T4 or A10 GPUs** for real-time scoring (~10k‚Äì50k events/sec)
- **A100/H100** for periodic retraining or large batch inference

GPU usage is elastic and scheduled via K8s (GKE, EKS, or AKS) with autoscaling.

### ‚úÖ 5. **Telemetry + Observability**
Every detection, score, and action is:
- Logged in structured format
- Shipped to Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana dashboards
- Correlated with cost and latency metrics
- Ingested into the tamper-evident blockchain

## üîç Real Example: Three-Region Risk Detection Cluster

A multinational organization deployed EBMs across three continents:

- Each region hosts an inference node behind a lightweight API gateway.
- Models sync every 24 hours‚Äîor immediately if hotfix thresholds are breached.
- GPU nodes are burstable and scheduled with cost ceilings.
- The average end-to-end detection latency (from log ingestion to action)
  - **Under 97ms** with 99.9993% accuracy.
  - Inference latency (p95) **< 100ms per event**
  - Model sync time **< 5 seconds per region update**
  - Model drift (energy Œî) **< 10% shift in energy distribution week-over-week**
  - Training runtime **< 2 hours per regional batch**
  - GPU utilization **60-90% (training), 30-50% (inference)**

## üí∞ Budgeting for Real-Time Defense

| Component                  | Est. Cost Range (Monthly)           |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| T4 GPU (real-time scoring)| \$300‚Äì\$500/node                    |
| A100 GPU (training)       | \$2.50‚Äì\$3.00/hr (spot pricing)     |
| Blob/CDN distribution     | \$50‚Äì\$200/month depending on model size |
| Observability stack       | \$150‚Äì\$500/month                   |

Compare that to one critical incident that goes undetected‚Äî**this is cheap insurance**.

## üß© Why Infra Is a Strategic Lever

| Constraint           | Without Infra Planning                  | With Infra Strategy                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Latency              | Centralized scoring delays action        | Local scoring = fast response               |
| Model freshness      | Undetected drift, stale logic            | Versioned updates, drift monitoring         |
| Cost efficiency      | Idle GPU waste or over-provisioning      | Elastic, job-based GPU usage                |
| Global consistency   | Inconsistent detections across regions   | Synced models and logic everywhere          |

Security isn‚Äôt just what you detect. It‚Äôs **where and how fast you detect it.**

## üéØ Your Move

Ask yourself:
- Can your detection pipeline handle burst traffic?
- Are your models versioned, tested, and regionally deployable?
- Is your response logic scalable‚Äîor centralized and brittle?

> If you don‚Äôt know, your infrastructure might be the bottleneck.

üëâ **Build your detection like a global product.** The threats are distributed. Your defenses should be too. Read the full white paper or dive into the latest podcast episode to learn more.

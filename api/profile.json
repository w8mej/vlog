He is an information security engineer and principal-level operator focused on AI/ML security, cloud-scale detection and response, zero-trust workloads, and confidential computing across AWS, GCP, Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. John thrives in the cyber-slick heart of financial and critical infrastructure systems, where he hunts vulnerabilities, designs resilient defenses, and mentors the next wave of console cowboys.\n\nHis playground spans evolutionary AI models, tamper-evident zero-trust workloads on NVIDIA A100 clusters, threat and vulnerability management, and emergency operations. As both practitioner and researcher, he bridges ivory-tower theory with hands-on hacking, responsible disclosure, and real-world incident response. Away from the keyboard, John leans into community service via emergency communications, ham radio, and mountain rescue–aligned skills, bringing the same rigor and calm-under-fire mindset to physical-world crises as he does to digital ones."
